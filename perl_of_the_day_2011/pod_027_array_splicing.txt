Hello,

splice() - a function to add/remove elements anywhere in an array 

splice ARRAY,OFFSET,LENGTH 
splice ARRAY,OFFSET 
splice ARRAY,OFFSET,LENGTH,LIST 

Removes the elements designated by OFFSET and LENGTH from an array,
  and replaces them with the elements of LIST, if any.
If LENGTH is omitted, removes everything from OFFSET onward.

In list context, returns the elements removed from the array.
In scalar context, returns the last element removed, or undef if no elements are removed.
The array grows or shrinks as necessary.
If OFFSET is negative then it start that far from the end of the array.
If LENGTH is negative, leave that many elements off the end of the array. 

Simple example - sequentially taking up to 3 elements from the array:

my @ar = qw( aa bb cc dd ee ff gg hh kk ll mm );
print "@ar\n";

my $pos=0;
my $len=3;
my @pp=();
my @tmp = @ar; # make a copy, because splice destroys the original
while (@pp = splice(@tmp,$pos,$len)) {
  print "@pp\n";
}

Output:
aa bb cc dd ee ff gg hh kk ll mm
aa bb cc
dd ee ff
gg hh kk
ll mm
