Today's topic is Schwartzian Transform.

This is basically a 3-step sorting method proposed by Randal Schwartz.

For example, let's say you have a list of emails - and you want to sort them by domain name.
Here is how it is done:

my @sorteddata =                           # Schwartzian Transform: 
  map {$_->[0]}                            # map back 
  sort { $a->[1] cmp $b->[1] }             # sort by cleanned element 
  map { m/@([a-zA-Z0-9\-.]*)\b/; [$_, $1]} # map to a list anon.2-element arrays 
  @data; 

Explanation:

Read the above statement from bottom to top (from right to left, from end to beginning)

Step1:
   use map to convert each email from @data array into an anonymous array with 2 elements: [email, domain]
   so now you have array of anonymous arrays

Step2:
   sort this array by domain
   Now you have sorted array of anonymous arrays 

Step3:
   use map to extract emails from sorted array
