Hello,

Below is an example of how to do substitutions in multiple files "in place".
This was already discussed earlier, but worth repeating.
We will sue 3 options:
 -e - execute the perl code provided on cmd line
 -p - read each line into $_, execute your code, and then print $_
 -i  - "in place", that is, print into the original file (change the original)

Note: in the command below the order of cmd options "p" and "i" is important.
  "-pi"  works, but   "-ip"   doesn't work.

perl -pi -e 's{/a/n142420/L2/bin/runCmds.pl}{../bin/runCmds.pl}g;' *.sh

The command above runs a substitute command s{}{}g  on contents of all *.sh files.
Namely, it looks for a pattern like this:

    /a/n142420/L2/bin/runCmds.pl

and substitutes it to relative path:

    ../bin/runCmds.pl
