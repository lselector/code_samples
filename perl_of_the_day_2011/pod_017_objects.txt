Today's issue is about Perl's classes and objects.

New Perl 6 does have classes and objects as part of the language.
But Perl 6 is not available yet for production use.

Perl 5 doesn't have classes as part of the language.
There are modules which implement complete OO framework (see father below),
but mostly programmers use simple objects implemented as following:
  - a module's namespace (a package) as a class name
  - anonymous hash as an object.
    use bless() function to change the label on this hash
    (to tell perl that this is an object, and not just a hash)
  - the constructor is  a function with any name (usually new())
    which creates an anonymous hash, changes the label using bless() function, 
    does some initialization of hash elements, and returns reference to this hash.

I highly recommend this tutorial:
  http://perldoc.perl.org/perltoot.html

The mechanism described above is very simple. 
It doesn't support privacy, though.
If you want a framework which supports proper OOP paradigms - google for "inside-out objects".
