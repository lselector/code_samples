Hello,

Here-docs is a way to specify a multi-string text, for example:

my $str = <<EOT;
some text1
some text2
EOT

print $str,$/;
 
the EOT can be any word.

Important that at the end of the here-doc this word is at the very beginning of the line, and it is the only thing on the line.

Perl supports here-docs similar to how shells support them.
See here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document

By default the content of the text is treated as it is in double-quotes.
You can explicitly specify what kind of quotes you want to use by specifying them around the word like this:

my $city = 'New York';

my $str1 = <<'END';
city = $city
END

print $str1,$/;   # prints city = $city

my $str2 = <<"END";
city = $city
END
print $str2,$/;   # prints city = New York

You can start more than one here-doc on one line, for example:

$m='mama';
$p='papa';
print "---------------------\n";

&mumu(<<'EOT1' ,  <<"EOT2");
$m
$p
EOT1
$m
$p
EOT2
print "---------------------\n";

sub mumu {
 my $s1 = shift;
 my $s2 = shift;
 print "$s1$s2\n";
}
