Hello

Some interesting perl idioms:
  https://github.com/book/perlsecret/blob/master/perlsecret.pod

For example, 

# convert string to a number
0+ $string

@{[  ]} - performs list interpolation inside a double-quoted string

~~  is equivalent to scalar()

!! - convert to boolean value

~~<> - same as scalar(<STDIN>)

=()=  can be used count or to select values into a list:

# incerting matches into @c
$n =(@c)= "abababab" =~ /a/g;   #  @c now contains ('a','a','a','a')

# counting
$n =()= /word1|word2|word3/g;

<~>   is equivalent to $ENV{HOME}  (under unix)

etc.

Warm Regards
