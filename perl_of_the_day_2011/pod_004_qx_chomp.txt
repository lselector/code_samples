Today - several examples of using backticks ( ` ... `  or qx{ ... } )  to take advantage of unix commands.

Here is how to get current date from inside perl using unix date command:

    chomp(my $yyyymmdd = qx{date +\%Y\%m\%d});

Note - you can also use regular method using localtime() function - but the line above is shorter.
I use it when I am lazy and when speed is not the main concern.
Note also the use of chomp() to remove trailing new-line symbol.

Another example - get a listing of certain files in a directory:

   chomp(my @files = qx{/bin/ls -1 *.txt});

Note in the example above that chomp will chomp every element of the array.

Another example - get a result of grep command into an array:

  chomp (my @fnames = qx{grep -l  mykeyword  *.txt});

Another example - reading a short file:

   my $txt = qx{cat  $fname};

or

   chomp(my @lines = qx{cat  $fname});
