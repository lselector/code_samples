Hello,

It is worth repeating that false values in perl are:
  undef - undefined value
  0     - zero number
  ""    - empty string - really empty, no spaces
  "0"   - string containing one zero and no other characters

Note - if you have warnings turned on   (via using "-w" option or via saying:  use warnings;)
then you may get warnings like this:

    Use of uninitialized value at test.pl line 8.

Note - you only will get them if you are trying to do math operation or comparison with the undefined value, for example:

use strict ;
use warnings;
my $aa = undef;
if ($aa > 0) {
   ...

If you just say
     if ($aa)   or     if (!$aa)
then there will be no warning.
