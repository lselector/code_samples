
map & grep functions

Explained very well in this old article:
http://usenix.org/publications/login/1998-6/perl.html

map() transforms, grep() filters.

I usually add ";" right after the openning curly to tell perl 
that this is a piece of code and not an anonymous hash.
Like this:
@result = map {; code } list;
@result = grep {; code } list 

Note also that there is no comma after closing curly.

For each element of the list
the element is put into the $_, then the expression
in curlies is evaluated, the result of last operation 
in curlies is returned into the result.
Example:
  @times_ten = map {; $_ * 10 } 1..10; 

Here is a frequent idiom - populate hash from array:

my %hh;
%hh = map { $_ => 1 } @arr;
